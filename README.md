# Decision Tree Interactive Module

An interactive learning module built with React, designed to help students understand decision trees in a fun and engaging way. This module allows users to visualize decision trees, interact with them, and even create their own custom decision trees.

## Features

- **Interactive Decision Tree**: Visualize and interact with decision trees, answering questions at each node.
- **Animated Nodes**: Adds animations to the decision nodes for a more dynamic user experience.
- **Create Your Own Tree**: A form that allows users to create and customize their own decision tree.
- **Scoring and Rewards**: Based on user choices, the app handles scoring and rewards logic.
- **Predefined Trees**: A set of predefined decision trees to explore.
